# Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services-Homework

This repository is my first homework assignment of UNH Coding Bootcamp.
The goal of the assignment was to refactor an existing webpage so that it includes semantic html tags and consolidate css selectors and properties.

The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://thetiiiim.github.io/Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services-Homework/)
